Format of file needed to run classifier on 2017 data:
Header:
Rk,Year,Date,Region,Round,Seed0,School0,Seed1,School1,OT,Diff,City,State,Zipcode,Latitude,Longitude

Rk: Can be a dummy int value
Year: 2017
Date: Dummy
Region: Dummy
Round: Put in in this format:
	if rd == 'First Round':
		return 0.9 * seed
	elif rd == 'Second Round':
		return 0.7 * seed
	elif rd == 'Regional Semifinal' or rd == 'Third Round':
		return 0.5 * seed
	elif rd == 'Regional Final':
		return 0.3 * seed
	elif rd == 'National Semifinal':
		return 0.15 * seed
	elif rd == 'National Final':
		return 0.1 * seed
	elif rd == 'Opening Round' or rd == 'First Four':
		return 0
Seed0: Seed in int form
School0: School id
Seed1: Seed in int form
School1: School id
OT: dummy
Diff: If School1 won the game, any positive integer, so you could put 1. If school0 won, make it >0. In the Kaggle dataset, it's the point differential in the game.
City: Dummy, but if you put in the actual city, it might be easier to find the location of the game.
State: Dummy, but same as above
Zip: Dummy
Latitude and Longitude columns: First number positive, 2nd negative. So if you google search `Durham NC coordinates`, make the second number negative.
